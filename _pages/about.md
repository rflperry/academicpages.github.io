I am a junior at The Johns Hopkins University studying applied mathematics and biomedical engineering. My interests are broad but I am especially interested in the theory behind network science, stochastic processes, time series, image analysis, and decision theory. I am interested in computational data science applications in fields anywhere from neuroscience to finance. Check out some of my projects and feel free to contact me!

Besides being a nerd, I enjoy running, baking sourdough bread, strategic board games, and reading authors like Nassim Taleb and George RR Martin.
