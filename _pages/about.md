I am a student at The Johns Hopkins University pursuing a Master's degree in Biomedical Engineering with a focus in biomedical data science, graduating in May 2020. I graduated with a B.S. in Applied Math & Statistics from Johns Hopkins in 2019. My interests are broad but I am especially interested in statistical decision theory and theoretical methods for working with data with structured features, such as network-valued and spatial data in a variety of domain areas. I am currently working in the Johns Hopkins [NeuroData Lab](https://neurodata.io/about), developing a [toolbox](https://mvlearn.netlify.com/index.html) of multiview learning methods for work on neuroimaging data and running experiments and developing theory related to a special variant of [random forests](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.11799.pdf). Check out some of my projects and feel free to contact me!

In my free time, I enjoy running, climbing, swing dancing, baking sourdough bread, board games, ultimate frisbee, and reading.
