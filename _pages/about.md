I am a research assistant in the Johns Hopkins [NeuroData Lab](https://neurodata.io/about) where my work focuses on [oblique random forests](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.11799.pdf) for data with structure, developing a [Python library](https://mvlearn.neurodata.io/) of multiview learning methods, and running [statistical analyses](https://rflperry.github.io/files/ohbm2020_poster_rperry.pdf) on fMRI data sets. I graduated from Johns Hopkins in 2019 with a Bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics & Statistics and in 2020 with a Master's degree in Biomedical Engineering during which I completed my [thesis](https://jscholarship.library.jhu.edu/bitstream/handle/1774.2/62715/PERRY-THESIS-2020.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y) on oblique random forests. Beyond my immediate work, my interests are broad but include statistical decision theory, methods for network-valued data, and geospatial visualizations. Check out some of my projects and feel free to contact me!

In my free time, I enjoy running, climbing, swing dancing, baking sourdough bread, board games, ultimate frisbee, and reading.
