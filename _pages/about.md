I am a research assistant with Dr. Joshua Vogelstein at the Johns Hopkins [NeuroData Lab](https://neurodata.io/about) and incoming Fulbright 21/22 Scholar at the [Max Planck Empirical Inference Department](https://ei.is.mpg.de/) in Germany. [My work](https://rflperry.github.io/papers/) focuses on oblique random forests for inference on data with structure, a Python library for working with multiview data, and nonparametric hypothesis testing with applications to fMRI data sets. Preveiously, I attended Johns Hopkins University where I received a Bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics & Statistics and a Master's degree in Biomedical Engineering, focusing in biomedical data science. Beyond my immediate work, my interests are broad but include causal inference, decision theory, methods for network-valued data, and geospatial visualizations.

In my free time, I enjoy [running](https://www.strava.com/athletes/53839031), climbing, swing dancing, baking sourdough bread, board games, ultimate frisbee, and [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/107774777-rp).
