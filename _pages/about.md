I am an undergraduate at The Johns Hopkins University, graduating with a B.S. in Applied Math & Statistics and an M.S. in Biomedical Data Science in May 2020 through the combined bachelors/masters program. My interests are broad but I am especially interested in learning theory and data science for real world problems. I am currently working in the Johns Hopkins [https://neurodata.io/about/team/](Neurodata Lab), developing a [https://github.com/NeuroDataDesign/multiview](toolbox) of multiview learning methods for work on neuroimaging data. Check out some of my projects and feel free to contact me!

In my free time, I enjoy running, climbing, ultimate frisbee, baking sourdough bread, board games, swing dancing, and reading.
