I am a student at The Johns Hopkins University pursuing a Master's degree in Biomedical Engineering with a focus in biomedical data science, expected graduation May 2020. I graduated with a B.S. in Applied Math & Statistics from Johns Hopkins in 2019. My interests are broad but I am especially interested in statistical decision theory and theoretical methods for working with structured data, such as network-valued and spatial data, with applications to environmental health and social problems. I am currently working in the Johns Hopkins [NeuroData Lab](https://neurodata.io/about), developing a [toolbox](https://github.com/NeuroDataDesign/multiview) of multiview learning methods for work on neuroimaging data. Check out some of my projects and feel free to contact me!

In my free time, I enjoy running, climbing, swing dancing, baking sourdough bread, board games, ultimate frisbee, and reading.
