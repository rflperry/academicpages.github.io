I am a senior at The Johns Hopkins University in the departments of Biomedical Engineering and Applied Mathematics & Statistics. My interests are broad but I am especially interested in theory surrounding network science, stochastic processes, image analysis, and decision theory. I am interested in computational data science applications, currently working on neuroscience projects but interested in expanding to environmental science. Check out some of my projects and feel free to contact me!

In my free time, I enjoy running, climbing, ultimate frisbee, baking sourdough bread, board games, and reading authors like Nassim Taleb and George RR Martin.
