I am an undergraduate at The Johns Hopkins University, pursuing degress in applied mathematics and biomedical engineering. I have a passion for mathematics, computer science, and generally all things logical. Biomedical topics are just a subset of the many applications I find fascinating. Check out some of my projects as I attempt to document my interests and work!
