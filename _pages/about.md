I am a senior at The Johns Hopkins University in the departments of Biomedical Engineering and Applied Mathematics & Statistics. My interests are broad but I am especially interested in learning theory and applied data science. I am currently working on applied projects in neuroscience but am interested in expanding to other fields such as environmental science. Check out some of my projects and feel free to contact me!

In my free time, I enjoy running, climbing, ultimate frisbee, baking sourdough bread, board games, and reading.
