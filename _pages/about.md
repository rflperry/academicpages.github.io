I am a research assistant in the Johns Hopkins [NeuroData Lab](https://neurodata.io/about) where my work focuses on [oblique random forests](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.11799.pdf) for data with structure, developing a [Python library](https://mvlearn.neurodata.io/) of multiview learning methods, and running statistical analyses on fMRI data sets. I graduated from Johns Hopkins in 2019 with a Bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics & Statistics and in 2020 with a Master's degree in Biomedical Engineering, concentrating in biomedical data science. Beyond my immediate work, my interests are broad but include statistical decision theory, methods for network-valued data, and geospatial visualizations. Check out some of my projects and feel free to contact me!

In my free time, I enjoy running, climbing, swing dancing, baking sourdough bread, board games, ultimate frisbee, and reading.
