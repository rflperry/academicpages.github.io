I am a rising senior at The Johns Hopkins University studying applied mathematics and biomedical engineering. My interests are broad but I am especially interested in theory surrounding network science, stochastic processes, image analysis, and decision theory. I am interested in computational data science applications in fields anywhere from neuroscience to finance. Check out some of my projects and feel free to contact me!

In my free time, I enjoy running, climbing, ultimate frisbee, baking sourdough bread, strategic board games, and reading authors like Nassim Taleb and George RR Martin.
