* ### Solving the Shortest Common Superstring Problem via Deep Reinforcement Learning ([link](/files/dldo_scsp_6-18.pdf)) and *[Github repo](https://github.com/rflperry/dl-scsp)*

  Semester project for my Deep Learning for Discrete Optimization class. The shortest common superstring is an NP-hard problem often found in the context of computational genomics. We expand upon recent techniques and use deep reinforcement learning to learn parameters for a heuristic solver.

* ### Linking the Caenorhabditis elegans nervous system neural connections and developmental history ([link](/files/C__elegans_lineages.pdf))
   
   NeuroData Design semester project in the NeuroData lab.

======
* ### [Yelp Dataset Challenge 2018](https://rflperry.github.io/yelp_challenge2018/)

    Social Graphs and Interactions class final project.
